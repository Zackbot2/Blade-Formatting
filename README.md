# Blade Formatting
A Visual Studio Code extension adding syntax highlighting for Blade to assembly files.
## Blade?
Blade is a toy operating system made within Turing Complete. It can be found [here](https://github.com/Zackbot2/Blade). 

Editing files within the game is a lengthy process and is expensive in terms of processing power. Files can be edited using an external IDE, however syntax features won't be present. This extension provides syntax highlighting when using vscode.
